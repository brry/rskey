This package contains the function setKeyboardBindings.
It will write to '~/.R/rstudio/keybindings/***.json' if the user consents.
While writing to disc is typically not allowed on CRAN, I would love to get an exception for this.
It greatly enhances the ease-of-use of this package and explicitly asks for permission.
It is not run in the examples, so CRAN machines should see no problems whatsoever.
Thanks ahead,
Berry
